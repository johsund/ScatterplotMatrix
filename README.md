# ScatterplotMatrix
d3 Scatterplot Matrix visualization for Qlik Sense

This visualization is based on Mike Bostock's excellent Scatterplot Matrix Brusing example (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063663).

It comes with a demo based on a FIFA 14 dataset showing a matrix of scatterplots comparing players across different metrics.
The extension is fully interactive with selection support based on brushing.
